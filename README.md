Component Library Color Brand Guidelines

Introduction

Welcome to the Color Brand Guidelines for our Vue.js Component Library. These guidelines will help you understand how to effectively use color codes within our library, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience. Our color scheme revolves around three main directives: primary, secondary, and warning.

Color Palette

Our color palette is designed to provide clarity, hierarchy, and emphasis in your Vue.js applications. Here are the key colors:

Primary (Blue)
HEX: #007BFF
RGB: 0, 123, 255
Use for primary actions and interactive elements, such as buttons, links, and important call-to-action items.
Secondary (Yellow)
HEX: #FFC107
RGB: 255, 193, 7
Use for secondary actions and elements that require user attention but are not as critical as primary actions.
Warning (Red)
HEX: #FF3D00
RGB: 255, 61, 0
Use for warning messages, alerts, and to draw immediate attention to critical information.
Usage Guidelines

Primary Directive

Use the primary directive for components that represent the main actions or primary focus in your application.
Examples of components that should use primary include primary buttons, navigation links, and key call-to-action elements.
Do not overuse the primary directive; reserve it for the most important actions to maintain visual hierarchy.
Secondary Directive

Utilize the secondary directive for components that are less critical than primary actions but still require user attention.
Examples of components that should use secondary include secondary buttons, informative badges, and non-critical alerts.
Use secondary sparingly to avoid visual clutter.
Warning Directive

Employ the warning directive for components that convey critical alerts, errors, or warnings.
Examples of components that should use warning include error messages, warning banners, and confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.
Use warning judiciously, as it represents critical information.
